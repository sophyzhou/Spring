##Benefit of using Spring 
* Works on POJOs. Hence easier for dependency injection/injection of test data.
* With the Dependency Injection approach, dependencies are explicit and evident in constructor or JavaBean properties.
* Enhances modularity. Provides more readable codes.
* Provides loose coupling between different modules.
* Effective in organizing the middle-tier applications.
* Flexible use of Dependency injection. Can be configured by XML based schema or annotation-based style.
* Supports declarative transaction, caching, validation and formatting.
