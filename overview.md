#Spring-Overview 

**Spring framework** is an open source Java platform released in 2003 and written by Rod Johnson, which provides comprehensive infrastructure support for developing robust Java applications. Millions of developers around the world use Spring Framework to create high performing, easily testable, reusable code.

The core features of the Spring Framework can be used in developing any Java application, but there are extensions for building web applications on top of the Java EE platform. Spring framework targets to make J2EE development easier to use and promote good programming practice by enabling a POJO-based programming model.


##Benefit of using Spring 
* Works on POJOs. Hence easier for dependency injection/injection of test data.
* With the Dependency Injection approach, dependencies are explicit and evident in constructor or JavaBean properties.
* Enhances modularity. Provides more readable codes.
* Provides loose coupling between different modules.
* Effective in organizing the middle-tier applications.
* Flexible use of Dependency injection. Can be configured by XML based schema or annotation-based style.
* Supports declarative transaction, caching, validation and formatting.


##Architecture
Spring could potentially be a one-stop shop for all your enterprise applications, however, Spring is modular, allowing you to pick and choose which modules are applicable to you, without having to bring in the rest. Following section gives detail about all the modules available in Spring Framework.

The Spring Framework provides about 20 modules which can be used based on an application requirement.
